				<h1 style="margin-top: 3rem;">About us</h1>
				<p style="color: #ffffffb0;">
					NZ Final Drives provides New Zealanders with affordable high quality after-market final drives. We're proud to be partnered with AUS Final Drives, who have been doing business in Australia since 2015.
					<br><br>
					By keeping our overheads to a minimum and leveraging off our international partners, we're able to generate more sales, resulting in greater savings for our customers. We only sell brand-new final drives, which come included with a 2-year unlimited-hour warranty.
					<br><br>
					And if that wasn't enough, our drives are carefully packed and couriered all across New Zealand, with free delivery to the Wellington region.
				</p>
